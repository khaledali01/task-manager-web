# Todo List Manager

The Todo List Manager is a simple web-based application that allows users to manage their tasks.

## Features

- Add tasks with titles and creation dates.
- Delete tasks individually.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html): A web server solution stack containing Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khaledali01/task-manager-web

2. Move the project folder into the XAMPP's htdocs directory. This is typically located at C:\xampp\htdocs on Windows or /opt/lampp/htdocs on Linux.

## Usage

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost/task-manager-web

You will see the Todo List Manager interface. You can add tasks by entering the task title in the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button.
